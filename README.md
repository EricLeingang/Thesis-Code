# Thesis-Code
Applying Modern Portfolio Theory to Employee Selection

This is the code for the four simulations for my Master's Thesis.  
Adjust the number of trials for a quicker demonstration.
For example 1,000 trials for the cutoff simulation (3) takes about 1.5 hours
on a decently fast PC.  10,000 trial takes 15 hours, etc.

The Thesis associated with this code can be found on the MNSU.edu website, 
and researchgate.
